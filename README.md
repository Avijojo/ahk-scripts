# AutoHotKey Scrips
AutoHotKey scrips I use (for personal use)
These scripts contain anything from things that quickly lock your PC to just random stuff I thought could be useful.

In order for these scripts to work, you'll need
 - [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (latest version)

# Instructions

 3. Double click/start the script you want to use
