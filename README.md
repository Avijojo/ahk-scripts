# AutoHotKey Scrips
AutoHotKey scrips I use (for personal use)
These scripts contain anything from things that quickly lock your PC to just random stuff I thought could be useful.
# Dependencies
In order for these scripts to work, you'll need
 - AutoHotKey (latest version)
 - Git (optional, cloning the repo)
