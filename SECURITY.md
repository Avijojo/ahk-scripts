## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there's somehow a vulnerability in one of my scripts, please email me (avenred@pm.me) with subject "Vulnerability in ahk-scripts"

I'm new to coding so please explain what the vulnerability is and how to fix it, don't make a PR request or anything about the vulnerability, just email me privately.

If I find your vulnerability to be legitimate, I will change the code as soon as possible to fix the vulnerability.

If I find your vulnerability to not be legitimate, I will email you back letting you know if I need any further details, or if your issue isn't a vulnerability.
